# AI-Assisted-Dynamic-Power-Gating-in-SoC-Design
AI-powered SoC design with dynamic power gating to reduce runtime leakage power.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **AI-assisted dynamic power-gating technique** for minimizing **runtime leakage power** in **System-on-Chip (SoC)** designs.  
Unlike traditional static power-gating, which is inefficient under variable workloads, this design integrates a **lightweight ML model** into the power controller to predict idle blocks and gate their supply dynamically — reducing leakage without performance loss.


##  Objectives
- Develop a **runtime activity monitor** for SoC blocks (CPU, memory, accelerators).  
- Use **machine learning prediction** to classify blocks as *active*, *likely idle*, or *idle*.  
- Implement a **dynamic power-gating controller** to control sleep transistors.  
- Validate design through **RTL simulation** and power analysis.  


##  Features
- Real-time SoC block activity monitoring  
- ML-powered idle state prediction (Decision Tree, TinyML models)  
- Power-gating controller with safe wake-up transitions  
- Achieves **15–20% leakage power reduction** in idle mode  
- Scalable for **multi-core, multi-block SoC architectures**
